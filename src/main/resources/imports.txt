crypto
| This module provides the necessary utilities that are required to hash
| content using different hashing mechanisms and algorithms.

encoding
| This module provides the necessary utilities,  which are  required  to
| encode and decode content using different URL encoding mechanisms  and
| algorithms.

io
| This module is designed to  support input  and  output  operations via
| channels in a canonical way,  either   in a blocking,  or non-blocking
| manner.

java
| This module provides the API for Java interoperability in Ballerina.It
| includes a set of Ballerina annotations with which Java constructors,
| methods, and fields can provide implementations of Ballerina functions
| with external function bodies.

java.arrays (imported as jarrays)
| This module provides APIs  to  create  new Java  array  instances, get
| elements from arrays, set elements, etc.

jsonutils
| This module provides utility functions to manipulate the built-in json
