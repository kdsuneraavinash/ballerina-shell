The Ballerina-shell tool is an interactive tool for learning the Ballerina programming language and prototyping Ballerina code. Ballerina-shell is a Read-Evaluate-Print Loop (REPL), which evaluates declarations, statements, and expressions as they are entered and immediately shows the results. Currently, the tool is run via the command line. Using Ballerina-shell, you can enter program statements one at a time and immediately see the result.
